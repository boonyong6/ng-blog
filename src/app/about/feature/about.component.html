    <p>
      I'm a software engineer with experience in full-stack web development,
      RESTful APIs, and cloud computing. I enjoy writing clean, maintainable
      code and learning more about software architecture and system design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on SaaS projects,
      building features with microservices architecture and cloud-based
      solutions. I've also gained experience in integration projects, including
      working with vendor systems, payment gateways, and third-party APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main tools include C#, .NET, Python, Django, NestJS, Angular, and
      TypeScript. I'm also familiar with databases like SQL Server, MySQL, and
      Google Cloud Datastore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always eager to grow as a developer and contribute to building
      software that makes a difference.
